#Iris Flower Classification

This project involves classifying iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica, using machine learning techniques. The dataset used is the famous Iris dataset which contains measurements for 150 iris flowers from three different species.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for training.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing the data to understand patterns and relationships.
Model Training: Using various machine learning algorithms to train a model on the dataset.
Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of the trained models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Prediction: Making predictions on new data using the trained model.
Getting Started
To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.
